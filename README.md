This repository is an archive of the codes I've written throughout my Programming for Data Science course.

There are three `.py` files inside about
  1. `python_exercsises.py`
    - Formative assessment exercises on basic python programming including python data types, object manipulation, etc.
  2. `numpy_pandas_exercises.py`
    - Formative assessment exercises on using `numpy` and `pandas` packages to optimize programming when dealing with data or array-like objects.
  3. `assignments.py`
    - Summative assessment exercises on #1 and #2.
